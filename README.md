News For You is a modern news website built with Next.js 14, using the App Router for fast, simple routing. I added a simple backend and enhanced the code to integrate seamlessly with it. The site fetches data from the backend, supports parallel and intercepted routes for smooth modal transitions, offers dynamic content via slug-based URLs, a responsive dark theme, and prioritizes a great user experience.
